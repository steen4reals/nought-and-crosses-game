# React Hackathon

For today's hackathon, we are going to practice extracting relevant information from resources that are solving the same problem but in a different way.

We will be making noughts and crosses - React style! To have stateful components in React before hooks were invented, you had to write a class component. You're going to be having a look at those today and transforming them into the React you now know and love.

Your task is to apply what you've learned so far about React while engaging with [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Extract what you need and use your knowledge of modern React to inform how you write your components.

Happy hacking!

PS: If you finish early and have your MVP of a functioning game with time left over, get creative and put your own spin on it with CSS or add new features such as a scoreboard.
